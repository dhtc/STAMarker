# STAMarker: Determining spatial domain-specific variable genes with saliency maps in deep learning
STAMarker is a three-stage framework that consists of an ensemble of graph attention autoencoders (STAGATE), an ensemble of MLP classifiers and saliency maps computation by the backpropagated gradient.
